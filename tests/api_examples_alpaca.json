A major social media platform's AI-powered content moderation system has suffered a public relations nightmare after a critical failure. An investigation reveals the AI moderation API's training data was subtly poisoned, causing it to misclassify harmful content, while its integration with a third-party image recognition API (used for pre-screening) is intermittently failing, leading to severe content slipping through. The CEO is scheduled for a live press conference in 90 minutes, demanding immediate answers and a fix. Your team must rapidly diagnose, isolate, and remediate the issues across multiple APIs, data pipelines, and AI models under intense public scrutiny.
