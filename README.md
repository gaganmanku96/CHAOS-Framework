## üöÄ Overview

The CHAOS (Contextual Hierarchical Adaptive Orchestration System) Framework generates synthetic training data that teaches AI systems to think through complex problems like human experts - with internal reasoning, confidence tracking, and adaptive strategies.

### Key Innovation

Traditional training teaches AI: `Task ‚Üí Steps ‚Üí Result`

CHAOS teaches AI: `Task ‚Üí Think ‚Üí Adapt ‚Üí Learn`

## üéØ Features

- **Progressive Difficulty Levels**: From simple single-tool tasks to chaotic multi-tool scenarios
- **Internal Reasoning System**: Multiple "voices" (Optimizer, Skeptic, Creative, Pragmatist) debate approaches
- **Confidence Tracking**: AI learns when to be certain vs. when to be cautious
- **Reality Breaks**: Unexpected discoveries that force strategy pivots
- **Emergent Behaviors**: Tool synthesis, constraint hacking, learning from failures

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chaos-framework.git
cd chaos-framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üèÉ Quick Start

### 1. Generate Your First Dataset

```bash
cd examples
python quick_start.py
```

This creates 25 sample scenarios across all difficulty levels.

### 2. Generate Large Training Dataset

```bash
python generate_large_dataset.py
```

Generates 1000+ scenarios for comprehensive training.

### 3. Convert to Training Format

```bash
cd ../src
python convert_to_training_data.py
```

Converts CHAOS scenarios to formats ready for fine-tuning (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

### Basic Generation

```python
from src.chaos_generator_progressive import CHAOSGenerator

generator = CHAOSGenerator()

# Generate single scenario
scenario = generator.generate_progressive_scenario(
    domain="technical",      # technical/business/research/creative
    difficulty="intermediate"  # simple/basic/intermediate/advanced/chaotic
)
```

### Custom Curriculum

```python
# Generate balanced curriculum
curriculum = generator.generate_curriculum_batch(count_per_level=100)
generator.save_curriculum(curriculum, "my_training_data")
```

### Gemini Enhancement (Optional)

```python
from src.chaos_generator_progressive import GeminiEnhancedGenerator

generator = GeminiEnhancedGenerator(api_key="YOUR_GEMINI_KEY")
scenario = generator.generate_progressive_scenario("business", "advanced")
```

## üìä Difficulty Levels

| Level | Tools | Complexity | Use Case |
|-------|-------|------------|----------|
| **Simple** | 1 | Straightforward | Teach basic tool usage |
| **Basic** | 1-2 | Minor issues | Handle simple problems |
| **Intermediate** | 2-3 | Reality breaks | Adapt to changes |
| **Advanced** | 3-4 | Complex reasoning | Multi-faceted problems |
| **Chaotic** | 4+ | Constant pivoting | Innovation under pressure |

## üß™ Example Scenario

```json
{
  "scenario": "Deploy critical hotfix during peak traffic. CEO is watching.",
  "internal_dialogue": [{
    "voices": {
      "optimizer": "Quick automated deployment will save time",
      "skeptic": "Peak traffic + CEO watching = high risk",
      "creative": "What about canary deployment?",
      "pragmatist": "Need visible progress for CEO"
    },
    "resolution": "Canary deployment with live metrics dashboard",
    "confidence": 70
  }],
  "reality_breaks": [{
    "discovery": "Deployment tool has 5-minute timeout",
    "adaptation": "Switch to manual rolling deployment"
  }],
  "confidence_trajectory": [70, 50, 30, 60, 85],
  "final_outcome": {
    "success_level": "full",
    "lessons_learned": ["Always have backup deployment method"]
  }
}
```

## üéì Training Philosophy

CHAOS teaches AI to:
1. **Think Before Acting**: Internal deliberation between multiple perspectives
2. **Track Confidence**: Know when certain vs. uncertain
3. **Adapt Gracefully**: Pivot strategies when things go wrong
4. **Learn from Failures**: Extract insights from what didn't work
5. **Match Complexity**: Use simple solutions for simple problems
